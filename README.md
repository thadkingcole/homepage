# [Baseball Roadtrip](https://thadkingcole.github.io/homepage)

<https://thadkingcole.github.io/homepage>

A simple static homepage that shares some details about my quest to visit all 30\* MLB ballparks.

The asterisk is due to new ballparks being built since the start of the journey, and you can’t be a baseball fan if you don’t put asterisks by certain stats.

Also, this website serves as my [pset8 homepage](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/8/homepage/) submission for [cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/).
